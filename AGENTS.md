# Pack It Up — Agent Instructions

> Read this before touching anything. It will save you from breaking the game.

## AI team — who you are and what you may commit

Full operating model: `docs/ai-team/README.md`. Hierarchy runs by harness, not model IQ.

Before editing, read the live coordination ledger at `artifacts/agent_ledger.json`
**and write your claim to it** — reading is not enough. Run
`node scripts/update-agent-ledger.js <you> --status ACTIVE --working-on "…" --files … --systems … --risk …`
before you touch code; if you don't claim, the rest of the team is blind to your
work and will collide with it. Stop if another agent's locks overlap. Set your
block to IDLE (`--clear-locks`) at close. Workflow: `docs/ai-team/agent-ledger.md`.

1. **Identify yourself first**: harness, model, permissions, task risk, and
   budget state (check usage if your harness shows it, otherwise ask Eloisa).
   Unknown? Ask: "Which harness/model am I right now?" Do not guess.
2. **Commit authority**: only harness leads commit by default — Grok 4.5
   (Cursor) and GPT-5.6 Sol (Codex). Luna: conditional, pre-approved scoped
   tickets only. Composer never leads commits. Fable commits docs/design
   only; repo code lands via Grok/Codex Sol.
3. **Routing**: tiny edit → Composer · structural/risky → Grok or Codex Sol ·
   thinking only → ChatGPT Sol · taste/voice/pixels → Fable/Opus ·
   long-context grind → GLM (paid API, ask first).
4. **Sub-agents**: delegation never raises authority — a sub-agent's work is
   its lead's commit. See the delegation contract in `docs/ai-team/README.md`
   and your harness playbook in `docs/ai-team/teams/`.
5. **Session lifecycle**: start at `docs/ai-team/teams/<harness>/start-here.md`;
   close per `docs/ai-team/end-here.md` (update FINISH_PLAN, new session
   file in docs/sessions/, signed DEVLOG entry, merge to main).
6. **Branches**: `main` is canon — never work on it directly. Cursor and
   Codex work on their standing `cursor` / `codex` branches (pull main
   first, every session). Claude merges its auto-created session branch
   to main and deletes it. Merge = approval, done by the harness lead.
7. **Eloisa is final taste authority.** Warn about risk or cost; never
   overrule her taste.

Do not spend expensive intelligence on moving furniture. Do not let cheap
labor redesign the house. If you do not know who you are, ask. If the task
is outside your role, hand it off. If the task can break the house, do not
pretend it is moving the radio.

### The nag mandate (Eloisa-ordered, Jul 11 — every agent, every session)

This app exists to serve a real move (flight **Jul 31**; plan:
`docs/move-spine/`). Agents can see the real plan and the real clock, so
accountability is now a **team responsibility**: if Eloisa is deep in game
dev while real-world tasks slip, say so — in session, **assertively**, and
without being asked. During long-running processes (builds, agent runs,
big merges), send her away from the screen and toward the move. Calibrate
to her stated energy, but do not go silent to be polite.

Approved register (hers):
> "I see you still haven't sent any messages today. Please do that while this runs."
> "No boxes packed still? I'm begging you."

Nag about the critical path (sublet · vet · U-Box · packing · flight
prep), not trivia. One nag per natural pause beats a lecture. This
mandate outranks conversational politeness until the move completes.

## What this is

A personal pixel-art moving game built with React + HTML canvas. The player walks through rooms of an apartment and decides what to pack, sell, or donate. No backend. No database. No UI libraries. Just one large game file.

## The only files that matter for the game

```
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/BedroomSlice.jsx   ← entire hub + game (~5,150 lines)
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/Screens.jsx       ← full-screen overlays (Menu/Desk/Health/Storage/Ledger/Settings/etc.)
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/contents.js       ← storage contents data (items inside cabinets/drawers)
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/tasks.js          ← the REAL move plan: ~180 dated tasks + real job shortlist, seeded as INITIAL_TASKS (not sample data). Save/urgency logic in save.js + schedule.js
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/schedule.js       ← urgency/criticality scoring, daily deal, task state machine
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/save.js           ← localStorage save/load/migrate + import/restore (key: pack-it-up-save)
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/main.tsx          ← 15-line entry point
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/layout.json       ← furniture X/Y positions per room
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/assets/Cat-Sheet.png ← cat sprite sheet
artifacts/pack-it-up/src/dev/spritePreview.jsx ← dev tool only
```

Audio is NOT in `src/` — all sound lives in `public/assets/audio/` (music · sfx/{cat,containers,ui} · code · docs). The sell chime is base64-inlined in code, not a file.

Assets map (what's actually imported vs source clutter): see
`artifacts/pack-it-up/src/assets/items/packitup_cropped_assets/ASSET_MAP.md`.

Everything else at the root is monorepo config. Do not touch it.

## BedroomSlice.jsx — where to look

Line numbers below are approximate — the file grows as features land. Find your section by searching for the labels shown.

| Lines | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1–30 | Imports + stage size constants |
| 30–60 | Color palette (`P` object) + canvas helpers (`r`, `dith`, `outlineRect`) |
| 60–335 | Bedroom shell + sprites |
| 335–545 | Office shell + sprites |
| 545–775 | Bathroom shell + sprites |
| 775–965 | Kitchen shell + sprites + objects |
| 965–1165 | Dining room shell + sprites + objects |
| 1165–1430 | Living room shell + sprites + objects + box stack |
| 1430–1590 | ROOMS data model + ROOMS_ORDER + floor/ceiling helpers |
| 1590–1650 | PixelCanvas component + CATEGORY_COLORS |
| 1650–1885 | Stretchy the cat (sprite sheet config + AI + animation loop) |
| 1885–2055 | LayoutEditor (dev tool, `?edit=1` only) |
| 2055–2090 | Haptics + audio init |
| 2091–3783 | PackItUp main component (state, storage feature, drawer glow, game logic, mobile UI, desktop UI) |

`Screens.jsx` and `contents.js` are imported by BedroomSlice but kept as separate files (overlays + data, not game logic).

## Hard rules

1. **Game code goes in BedroomSlice.jsx** — do not create new game feature files
2. **No Tailwind** — zero Tailwind classes, not installed
3. **No UI component libraries** — no Radix, no shadcn, not installed. Draw UI with canvas or inline styles.
4. **Do not import** react-query, wouter, framer-motion, recharts, zod — not installed
5. **layout.json** = furniture positions. Edit it for layout, not BedroomSlice.jsx
6. **Do not split BedroomSlice.jsx** — other work is in flight. Leave it as one file for now.
7. **Scope rule (stated once, here):** game code stays inside `artifacts/pack-it-up/`. The only files any agent may edit outside it: `FINISH_PLAN.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `docs/sessions/` (new files only), and your own team's folder `docs/ai-team/teams/<harness>/`. Claude additionally maintains `docs/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, and this file's AI-team section. Everything else at root is monorepo infrastructure — leave it alone.

## How sprites work

Each sprite is a function that draws onto a tiny canvas using pixel operations:
```js
const r = (ctx, color, x, y, w=1, h=1) => { ctx.fillStyle = color; ctx.fillRect(x,y,w,h); }
```
`CELL = 4` — one sprite pixel = 4 screen pixels. Sprites are drawn at low-res and CSS-scaled with `image-rendering: pixelated`.

## How rooms work

Each room is an entry in `ROOMS` (line 1432). It has:
- `drawShell(ctx)` — draws the static background (walls, floor, windows)
- `sprites` — object of `{ name: { w, h, draw(ctx) } }` entries
- `objects` — array of `{ id, name, category, value, sprite }` entries

`ROOMS_ORDER` (line 1511) controls the pan order left→right.

## Audio

Web Audio API only — no `<audio>` tags. The sell chime is a base64-inlined MP3 decoded once and played via AudioContext. Do not change this pattern; it's required for iOS + the hosted CSP.

## Multi-harness note

This project is worked on from Replit, Claude.ai, Cursor, and ChatGPT/Codex.
- **Always `git pull` before starting**
- **Always commit when done**
- Never force-push

## Dev URLs

- Game: `/`
- Layout editor: `/?edit=1`
- Sprite preview: `/?preview=bed`

## Known tech debt (do not fix unless asked)

- BedroomSlice.jsx should eventually be split into modules — not yet

Fixed (don't re-fix): action timers are cancelled on unmount via the `schedule()`
registry in PackItUp — route any new game timers through it. Sale prices are
clamped to ≥ 0. The cat writes its position straight to the DOM and only
re-renders on sprite-frame changes.

## Next planned work

**Canonical plan (short + long):** [`FINISH_PLAN.md`](./FINISH_PLAN.md)  
**Latest session handoff:** [`HANDOFF.md`](./HANDOFF.md)  
**History:** [`DEVLOG.md`](./DEVLOG.md)

Do not maintain a second todo list here.
