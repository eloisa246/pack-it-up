PACK IT UP AUDIO ASSET PACK

Drop this folder into your project as: assets/audio
(Live path: artifacts/pack-it-up/public/assets/audio/)

NAMING RULE (all new files): snake_case, purpose-first, numbered variants —
e.g. sfx/containers/fridge_open_close_01.mp3, sfx/ui/phone_ring_01.mp3.
Raw library filenames (spaces, "ES_...", "- Epidemic Sound") never get
committed: slice/rename to convention first, then wire, then delete the raw
source from the repo.

Included audio files:
- Music files: 10
- Cat SFX files: 16
- Container/object SFX files: 11
- UI SFX files: 3
- Total included audio files: 40

Main music:
- Cherry Blossom = default apartment/packing loop

Radio stations:
- POP 101: Pop Station (Some Kind of Beautiful) — available
- OLD 96: Oldies — available
- JAZZ 78: Jazz — available
- SYN 100: Synthwave — available
- BIT 90: 8-Bit (Guru Meditation) — available
- RNB 77: R&B — available

Manifest updates (vs original pack):
- Guru Meditation and Some Kind of Beautiful are now available.
- Dry (Instrumental) added to the music library.
- Sweet Dreams removed from the music library.

Important files:
- audio_index.csv: spreadsheet-style index with durations and source filenames
- code/audioManifest.js: importable JS manifest
- code/AudioManager.js: starter browser audio manager
- docs/RADIO_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.txt: implementation prompt for the game agent

Notes:
- Duplicate uploads of A Heart Made of Pixels and A Wink behind the Curtain were omitted; one copy each is included.
- Stretchy Content Meow Stretch and Stretchy Happy Meow Set had matched audio in the earlier split pass, so their shared cuts are included once as happy_content clips.
- Packing Nouse.mp3 was normalized to sfx/ui/packing_noise_01.mp3.
- sell_chime.mp3 lives at sfx/ui/sell_chime.mp3 (copied from src/sell.mp3).

How to use Stretchy meows (from this pack):
- happy_content → calm / content moments (idle, sit, stretch, soft look-at-you)
- stressed → mild task pressure / guilt glow starting
- desperate → high task pressure / red "!" guilt state
- Game rule of thumb: pick a random clip from the matching folder; keep volume low;
  do not spam. Prefer happy_content for ambient presence; reserve stressed/desperate
  for clear pressure beats so they don't feel like jump-scares.
