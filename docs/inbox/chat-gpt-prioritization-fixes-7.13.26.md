Use this as the Claude prompt card.

We are working on Pack It Up, repo: moving-time, app path likely `artifacts/pack-it-up`.
Goal: finish the Daily Hand / Ledger / task-data cleanup pass. Do not redesign UI, do not add new art, do not invent a new workflow. This is a logic/data cleanup task.
Current problem:
The Daily Hand system is confusing “minimum effort quota” with “bound cards.” It is binding future crit-3 tasks just to satisfy fumes quota, which makes nonsense hands like:
- h_lock
- h_keys_access
- h_finalize_address
on Jul 13, even though these are future/dependent/outcome cards and not the real next actions.
Also:
- Fumes has no extra/offer cards to draw.
- Steady/full screens can be exited without drawing enough additional cards.
- Full quota math should use effort and ceiling correctly. Example: 192 effort / 18 days = 10.6, so full quota should be 11, not 10.
- Archived/done/dismissed/old seed data is still confusing agents and should be removed or isolated.
- `dependsNote` is currently only text; it does not actually block anything.
- Some large/outcome tasks need to become non-dealable capstones or be split.
- Ledger/task labels for effort, urgency, criticality, availableFrom, dependencies, and exactDate need cleanup.
Definitions:
- Effort: 1 tiny, 2 medium, 3 heavy.
- Criticality:
  - 1 = optional/backburner/flexible
  - 2 = important, should appear in steady/full
  - 3 = true hard-deadline / move-failure / cat/flight/U-Box critical
- Urgency = time pressure / soonness, not importance.
- `targetDate` = when we want to start/aim.
- `latestDate` = last safe day.
- `exactDate` = must happen on that date.
- `availableFrom` = do not offer before this date.
- `dependencies` = hard block. `dependsNote` is only explanatory and must not be relied on for logic.
Main required changes:
1. Finish archived/seed cleanup
Remove archived/done/dismissed historical seed task objects from runtime seed lists so future agents do not treat them as live product data.
Keep only live seeded tasks in the active task source.
If old tasks are needed for migration/history, move them to a clearly named non-runtime file such as:
- `docs/archive/archived-task-seeds-july-2026.json`
- or `src/data/archivedTaskSeeds.NOT_IMPORTED.js`
Do not import archived seed data into the runtime task deck.
Preserve old-save compatibility:
- Old localStorage/save files may still contain archived/done/dismissed task ids.
- Runtime merge should not revive removed seed tasks.
- `REMOVED_TASK_IDS` or equivalent pruning should still remove deleted obsolete ids.
- Statuses from existing saves should be respected, but archived/done/dismissed tasks must not enter active deck, Ledger active view, Daily Hand, offer pile, quotas, or schedule pressure.
Acceptance:
- Active task list contains only open/pending live tasks.
- Archived/done/dismissed tasks do not affect quota math.
- Archived seed data is not imported by runtime.
- Old saves do not resurrect obsolete tasks.
2. Fix Daily Hand quota logic
Do not bind future criticality-3 tasks just to satisfy fumes quota.
Separate these concepts:
A. Bound / forced cards:
Only these should be bound:
- exactDate === today
- latestDate <= today for real non-selfTarget deadlines
- daily recurrence that must happen today
- manually locked/overridden cards
- true same-day hard blockers
B. Required effort quota:
This is the amount of total work the player should select for the chosen energy tier.
C. Offer pile:
This is the ranked pool the player can draw/select from.
Current bad behavior:
- fumes quota is computed from all crit-3 effort
- then `dealDailyHand()` fills bound cards with crit-3 tasks until boundEffort >= fumes quota
- this pulls future tasks into today
Fix:
- Remove the “fill bound with ranked crit-3 until fumes quota” behavior.
- Bound cards should be date/deadline forced only.
- Quotas should determine how much optional effort still needs to be selected, not what gets hard-bound.
Pseudo behavior:

bound = exactDateToday + pastLatestRealDeadlines + trueDailyRequired + manualLocked

boundEffort = sum(bound)

targetEffort = tierQuota[energy]

requiredOptionalEffort = max(0, targetEffort - boundEffort)

offerList = ranked actionable tasks not in bound

Fumes should also have offers.
Do not set `eligiblePool = []` for fumes.
Fumes behavior:
- If bound effort already satisfies fumes quota, requiredOptionalEffort = 0.
- Still show offers/swaps so the user can voluntarily add or replace work.
- User should be able to leave fumes if requiredOptionalEffort is 0.
- If requiredOptionalEffort > 0, user must select/draw enough effort before leaving.
Steady/full behavior:
- Must require enough selected optional effort before leaving/confirming.
- Do not allow exiting the card draw screen unless `remainingEffort <= 0`, unless there is a deliberate “lower energy” action.
- If user chooses “I cannot do this much,” downgrade energy tier instead of silently letting the hand be underfilled.
3. Fix quota calculation / rounding
All tier quotas must be effort-based and use ceiling.
Example:
- If full remaining effort is 192 over 18 usable days:
  - 192 / 18 = 10.666...
  - full quota = 11
Check for any display logic that floors/rounds incorrectly.
Acceptance:
- `Math.ceil(totalEffort / usableDays)` is used.
- Displayed quota matches stored `dailyQuota`.
- Full quota never shows 10 when math requires 11.
4. Fix offer pile and draw rules
Offer pile should include actionable tasks ranked by:
- true deadline pressure
- criticality
- availability
- dependencies
- category balance
- outcome penalty
- job cap
Offer pile must exclude:
- done
- archived
- dismissed
- blocked by dependency
- unavailable future tasks
- future exactDate tasks
- outcome/capstone tasks when their prerequisite actions are not done
Offer pile should include enough options for swapping:
- fumes: at least 4–8 offers if available
- steady: enough to satisfy required optional effort, plus extras
- full: enough to satisfy required optional effort, plus extras
Selection confirmation must be effort-based:
- Bound effort always counts.
- Selected optional effort counts.
- Card count does not matter.
- Confirm only when selected total effort reaches quota, unless quota already met by bound cards.
5. Allow swaps / manual correction
The app should support the mental model:
“The app tries; user corrects it; it obeys.”
Every recommended/bound hand card should be swappable unless it is truly exact-date or past-latest forced.
Swap behavior:
- Swap opens eligible active tasks sorted by priority.
- Replacement is saved as a same-day manual override for that slot.
- Manual override wins over scoring for the rest of the day.
- Manual override should not be overwritten by regeneration.
- Override clears if task becomes done/archived/dismissed/blocked.
- No separate “intent” flow.
Important:
- Outcome cards like `h_lock` should not become bound if the real next action is outreach/followup/qualify lead.
- Swapping a card is the user’s intent signal.
6. Fix dependency handling
`dependsNote` is not logic. Add real `dependencies` where needed.
Recommended dependency edits:
- `h_finalize_address` depends on `h_lock`
- `h_keys_access` depends on `h_lock`
- `a_usps` depends on `h_finalize_address`
- `a_bank` depends on `h_finalize_address`
- `h_forward_deposit_address` depends on `h_finalize_address`
- `f_remove_bedframe` depends on `f_bed_plan`
- `f_remove_mattress` depends on `f_bed_plan`
- `m_photo_lock` depends on `m_load_complete`
- `m_lock_final` depends on `m_lock`, `m_load_complete`, and probably `m_photo_lock`
- `h_photo_condition` depends on `h_moveout_clean`
- `h_restore_blinds` depends on `h_ask_blinds` and/or `h_walkthrough`
- `h_fill_holes` depends on walkthrough/curtain removal task if present
- `c_vet_attend` depends on `c_vet_book`
- `c_cert` depends on `c_vet_attend`
- `c_med_test` depends on medication pickup task
- `c_med_reaction` depends on `c_med_test`
- `t_labs` depends on the appointment/order task that creates lab orders, or rename it if it is directly actionable
- `t_med_bridge` should either be directly actionable (“request medication bridge/refills”) or depend on PCP approval
Acceptance:
- Tasks with incomplete dependencies are not offered, not bound, and not counted as actionable today.
- `dependsNote` can remain as display copy, but never substitutes for `dependencies`.
7. Fix availableFrom / future actionability
Future `targetDate` alone should not mean “doable now.”
Use `availableFrom` for tasks that should not appear early.
Recommended availableFrom fixes:
- `w_travel_checkin`: availableFrom or exactDate `2026-07-30`
- `c_kit`: availableFrom `2026-07-29` or `2026-07-30`
- `m_load_late_value`: availableFrom `2026-07-29`
- `m_load_complete`: availableFrom `2026-07-30`
- furniture removal tasks should generally remain blocked by buyer-plan dependencies, not merely available early
- health/cat tasks may remain available if they are actually bookable now
Acceptance:
- Jul 13 hand does not pull Jul 27–31 operational tasks just because they are criticality 3.
8. Convert outcome/capstone cards
Some cards are outcomes, not next actions. They should not be dealt unless prerequisites are satisfied or they are exact-date/past-latest.
Outcome/capstone examples:
- `h_lock` Lock the Aug 1 sublet
- `m_load_complete` Complete final U-Box load
- `m_lock_final` Lock the U-Box — packed by tonight
- possibly `m_load_main` Load U-Box
Rules:
- Outcome cards should be non-dealable or heavily penalized until prerequisite concrete actions are complete.
- Prefer concrete actions first: send, call, book, pack, reply, find buyer, confirm, photograph, load.
- Penalize vague verbs: lock, finalize, complete, secure, handle, finish, resolve, plan, decide.
Specific:
- `h_lock` should not beat housing outreach/followups/lead qualification.
- If no warm lead exists, app should offer outreach/followup, not “lock sublet.”
- If `h_outreach_daily` is done, the next housing card should probably be followups/lead qualification, not address/keys until locked.
9. Task-data criticality/effort edits
Apply or implement these data changes.
Move/admin packing:
- `m_lock`: criticality 1 → 3. Effort 1 ok. Consider target earlier than Jul 26.
- `m_labels`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_load_map`: criticality 3 → 2.
- `p_death_cords`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_pack_overflow`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_pack_bath`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_pack_office`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_sell_final`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_photo_lock`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `m_sweep`: criticality 2 → 3.
- `f_bed_plan`: criticality 3 → 2.
- `p_books`: if only upper hutch remains, effort 2 → 1.
- `p_electronics` overlaps with `p_death_cords`; merge, retarget, or add dependency so both do not represent the same collection.
- `p_guitar_amp`: object state says guitar case donated. If this means guitar gear is handled, mark done/archive; otherwise keep but probably criticality 2, not 3.
- `m_load_main`: too vague/duplicative. Either split into concrete load cards or make it a non-dealable umbrella outcome.
- `m_load_complete`: if this means final verification, effort 3 → 1. If it means finish all loading, split it.
Housing:
- `h_lock`: outcome/capstone. Do not deal before concrete lead actions. Add dependencies or mark non-dealable until ready.
- `h_ask_blinds`: criticality 3 → 2.
- `h_walkthrough_prep`: probably criticality 3 → 2.
- `h_restore_blinds`: criticality 3 only if landlord explicitly requires it; otherwise 2.
- `h_fill_holes`: probably criticality 2.
- `h_moveout_clean`: too broad. Split into:
  - Clean kitchen
  - Clean bathroom
  - Clean floors/surfaces
  - Final trash/donations
  - Photo-ready condition
- `h_empty_fridge`: criticality 3 / effort 1 ok.
Jobs:
- During move-crisis mode, cap jobs to max one dealt card per day unless user manually chooses more.
- `j_exec`: archive or convert to “check if still open.”
- `j_cphds`: archive or convert to “check if still open.”
- `j_student`: archive or convert to “check if still open.”
- `j_onboard`: triage/verify open, not high-priority app card.
- `j_equity`: triage/decide fit; do not compete with move-critical cards.
- `j_hpd`: keep as effort 1 follow-up.
- `j_hunter`, `j_hopwa1`, `j_hopwa2`: keep as optional job cards, but cap exposure.
- `j_labor`: set availableFrom after move or exclude until August.
Work/admin/travel:
- `w_wifi_cutoff`: probably criticality 2, not 3.
- `w_wifi_return_method`: probably criticality 2.
- `w_wifi_return`: keep criticality 3.
- `w_work_return_process`: probably criticality 2.
- `w_work_return`: criticality 3 ok if return has real consequences.
- `w_travel_transport`: criticality 3 / effort 1 ok.
- `w_travel_checkin`: add availableFrom or exactDate Jul 30.
- `w_flight`: ok.
Health:
- `t_heart`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `t_lymph`: criticality 1 → 2.
- `t_teeth`: criticality 2 / effort 2 ok.
- `t_skin`: ok.
- `t_obgyn`: ok.
- `t_labs`: add real dependency or rename as directly actionable.
- `t_med_bridge`: make directly actionable or add dependency.
Cat:
- `c_vet_book`: criticality 3 / effort 1 ok.
- `c_vet_attend`: depends on `c_vet_book`; once booked, set exactDate.
- `c_cert`: depends on `c_vet_attend`; fix impossible date conflict because it currently targets Jul 25 while vet attend is Jul 26.
- `c_med_test`: depends on medication pickup.
- `c_med_reaction`: depends on `c_med_test`.
- `c_kit`: add availableFrom Jul 29/30.
- `c_departure`: ok.
10. Ledger behavior
Ledger should make the data model legible and prevent bad edits.
Required:
- Ledger active view must hide done/archived/dismissed by default.
- Provide Archived view separately if already present, but do not mix with active deck.
- Label “Score” as “Priority” or “Fit” for jobs; do not imply it is scheduler pressure.
- Show criticality and effort clearly.
- If user edits due date, update structured schedule fields, not only display `due`.
- Trust structured dates over display strings.
- Display `due` is copy only; schedule logic must use `targetDate`, `latestDate`, `exactDate`, `availableFrom`, dependencies.
- If a task has `dependsNote` but no real dependency, flag it for cleanup or show as note only.
Ledger edit requirements:
- In Ledger, active tasks must be editable.
- User must be able to mark a task complete/done from Ledger.
- User must be able to edit effort: 1, 2, or 3.
- User must be able to edit criticality: 1, 2, or 3.
- User must be able to add/remove dependencies by selecting other task ids/titles.
- User must be able to edit availableFrom, targetDate, latestDate, and exactDate.
- Editing display `due` text alone is not enough; Ledger edits must update the structured scheduling fields used by the Daily Hand.
- If a task has `dependsNote` but no real `dependencies`, Ledger should surface that as “note only / not blocking” or offer a way to convert it into a real dependency.
- Ledger active view should allow completing, archiving, dismissing, and restoring tasks.
Criticality / effort audit edits to apply:

Use these meanings consistently:
- Criticality 3 = hard external deadline, move/travel/housing failure, financial/legal risk, or cannot miss.
- Criticality 2 = important and should be surfaced, but flexible or recoverable.
- Criticality 1 = optional, comfort, cleanup, nice-to-have, self-imposed, or low consequence.
- Effort 1 = quick call/text/click/simple physical action.
- Effort 2 = moderate admin or packing task, 30–60 min.
- Effort 3 = heavy, multi-step, emotionally/physically draining, or 60–120+ min.
- Anything bigger than effort 3 should be split into smaller tasks or treated as a milestone, not one dealt card.

Specific edits:

Housing:
- h_lock: keep criticality 3, effort 3, but treat as an outcome/milestone unless no concrete housing action exists.
- h_finalize_address: criticality 3, effort 1, add dependency on h_lock.
- h_keys_access: criticality 3, effort 1, add dependency on h_lock.
- h_confirm_extension: criticality 2, effort 1.
- h_ask_blinds: lower to criticality 2 unless landlord/deposit risk is confirmed.
- h_walkthrough_prep: criticality 2 or 3, effort 1, availableFrom 2026-07-24 is fine.
- h_walkthrough: criticality 3, effort 1, exact/fixed date.
- h_restore_blinds: criticality 3 only if landlord confirms required; otherwise criticality 2. Add dependency on h_walkthrough / landlord response.
- h_fill_holes: criticality 3 only if holes definitely exist; add dependency on curtain rods removed / walkthrough response.
- h_photo_condition: criticality 3, effort 1, add dependency on h_moveout_clean.
- h_forward_deposit_address: criticality 2, effort 1, add dependency on h_finalize_address.

Address/admin:
- a_usps: raise to criticality 2, effort 1, add dependency on h_finalize_address.
- a_bank: criticality 1, effort 1, add dependency on h_finalize_address.
- a_payout: criticality 1, effort 1.

Health:
- t_teeth: criticality 2, effort 2.
- t_heart: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- t_lymph: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- t_skin: criticality 1 or 2; not 3 unless there is a hard medical reason.
- t_obgyn: criticality 2, effort 2.
- t_labs: criticality 2, effort 2, add dependency on rheum/PCP order task.
- t_med_bridge: criticality 3, effort 1, but fix dependency logic. If PCP approval is already handled, remove the dependsNote; otherwise add a real dependency on the PCP/bridge approval task.

Cat / Stretchy:
- c_vet_book: criticality 3, effort 1, but should not bind before due/ready.
- c_vet_attend: criticality 3, effort 2, fixed/appointment-like.
- c_cert: criticality 3, effort 1, add dependency on c_vet_attend.
- c_med_test: criticality 3 or 2, effort 2, add dependency on medication pickup task. Do not depend on an archived task unless archived counts as completed.
- c_med_reaction: lower to criticality 2, effort 1, dependency on c_med_test.
- c_kit: criticality 3, effort 1.
- c_departure: criticality 3, effort 2, exact date.

Packing:
- p_books: if only office:hutch_books_upper remains, reduce effort from 2 to 1. Otherwise keep effort 2.
- p_death_cords: criticality 1, effort 2 is fine.
- p_decor: criticality 2, effort 3 is fine.
- p_art: criticality 2, effort 3, but availableFrom should be closer to actual packing window, not 2026-07-11.
- p_craft_supplies: criticality 2, effort 2 is fine.
- p_games: criticality 2, effort 1 is fine.
- p_winter_clothes: criticality 2, effort 3 is fine.
- p_linens: criticality 2, effort 1 is fine.
- p_barware: criticality 2, effort 3 is fine.
- p_outdoor_keep: criticality 2, effort 2 is fine.
- p_electronics: criticality 2, effort 2 is fine.
- p_dining_bar: criticality 2, effort 2 is fine.
- p_cat_belongings: criticality 2, effort 2 is fine.
- p_reduce_kitchen: criticality 2, effort 3 is fine.
- p_roll_rug_lamp: criticality 3, effort 2, availableFrom 2026-07-23 is fine.
- p_guitar_amp: consider lowering to criticality 2 unless it is truly move-blocking; effort 1 is fine.
- m_pack_office: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- m_pack_bath: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- m_pack_overflow: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- m_labels: raise from criticality 1 to 2.
- m_lock: raise from criticality 1 to 3 if this is the actual U-Box lock needed for pickup/security.
- m_load_map: lower from criticality 3 to 2 unless the load map is actually required for helpers/movers.

Furniture / selling:
- Buyer tasks should usually be criticality 2, effort 1.
- Removal tasks should usually be criticality 3, effort 1–2, but must be blocked by their buyer/decision task.
- f_bed_plan: lower from criticality 3 to 2 unless no plan creates direct move failure.
- f_remove_bedframe: add dependency on f_bed_plan.
- f_remove_mattress: criticality 3, effort 2, availableFrom 2026-07-30 is fine.

U-Box / loading:
- m_load1, m_load_main, and m_load_complete are too large/overlapping as dealt cards.
- Split actual loading into smaller actionable cards, or mark the big cards as milestones.
- Suggested split:
  - Load heavy/boring/low-theft first: effort 3, criticality 3, exact 2026-07-27.
  - Load furniture/large keep items: effort 3, criticality 3.
  - Load packed boxes by zone: effort 3, criticality 3.
  - Load late-value storage items: effort 2, criticality 3.
  - Final packed interior photo: effort 1, criticality 2.
  - Lock U-Box: effort 1, criticality 3, exact 2026-07-30.
- m_load_complete should become a milestone/checkoff after the split tasks, not a standalone huge effort-3 task.

Cleaning:
- h_moveout_clean is too large as one effort-3 card.
- Split into:
  - Clean kitchen: effort 2–3, criticality 3.
  - Clean bathroom: effort 2, criticality 3.
  - Floors/surfaces/trash pass: effort 2–3, criticality 3.
  - Final photo condition: effort 1, criticality 3, dependency on cleaning.
- If not split, keep h_moveout_clean as effort 3 but treat as a milestone, not a normal dealt card.

Work/Wi-Fi/travel:
- w_wifi_cutoff: criticality 3, effort 1 is fine.
- w_wifi_return_method: lower to criticality 2 unless method uncertainty blocks return.
- w_wifi_return: criticality 3, effort 2 is fine.
- w_work_return_process: lower to criticality 2 unless employer deadline is strict.
- w_work_return: criticality 2 or 3 depending employer consequence; effort 2 is fine.
- w_travel_transport: criticality 3, effort 1 is fine.
- w_travel_checkin: criticality 3, effort 1, add availableFrom 2026-07-30.
- w_flight: criticality 3, effort 1, exact date.

Jobs:
- Follow-up tasks are effort 1.
- Full applications are effort 3.
- Job tasks should not bind multiple slots during move crisis.
- j_cphds, j_exec, and j_student are stale/past self-target or likely expired; archive or suppress unless explicitly kept.
- j_onboard should be reviewed; archive/suppress if stale.
- Keep live jobs such as j_hpd, j_hunter, j_hopwa1, j_hopwa2, but cap daily job dealing to 0–1 unless user chooses job focus.
11. Daily cards / recurrence
`h_outreach_daily` and `s_fb_inbox` should not become stale one-off cards.
Fix:
- `h_outreach_daily` should recur/regenerate while housing is not locked, unless explicitly done for that day.
- `s_fb_inbox` should be refreshed daily or retargeted to today when still relevant.
- A daily task marked done today should not appear again today, but can appear tomorrow if still relevant.
- Do not keep old `targetDate` / `latestDate` from Jul 11 making it look stale forever.
12. Acceptance test for Jul 13 save
Given the Jul 13 save state where:
- `h_outreach_daily` is done
- current generated hand is wrongly `h_lock`, `h_keys_access`, `h_finalize_address`
- energy is full
- `boundEffort` is 5
- `requiredOptionalEffort` is 6
- full quota should be 11
Expected after fix:
- `h_keys_access` and `h_finalize_address` should be blocked by `h_lock`.
- `h_lock` should not be bound unless it is truly actionable/capstone-ready.
- Fumes should not bind future crit-3 cards just to meet quota.
- Full quota should be 11 if remaining effort math is 192/18.
- User cannot leave full draw until selected effort reaches quota, unless they downgrade energy.
- Fumes has offers available for optional draws/swaps.
- Suggested Jul 13 hand should contain concrete near-term actions, likely from:
  - `p_books`
  - `p_games`
  - `p_craft_supplies`
  - `p_winter_clothes`
  - `s_fb_inbox`
  - `t_teeth`
  - `t_skin`
  - `t_obgyn`
  - `f_buyer_dining`
  - `f_buyer_outdoor`
  - `f_buyer_shoeshelf`
  - maybe one job max if full energy and enough quota remains
13. Implementation constraints
Do not:
- Redesign the UI.
- Add a new intent screen.
- Add complex AI/API picking.
- Let display `due` strings drive scheduling.
- Let archived seed data remain in active runtime task source.
- Let future targetDate tasks bind today just because they are criticality 3.
- Let `dependsNote` act like a dependency.
Do:
- Keep changes deterministic, local, and debuggable.
- Prefer small helper functions with clear names.
- Add comments where the old behavior was wrong.
- Add console/debug summary if useful:
  - bound cards and why bound
  - required optional effort
  - selected optional effort
  - remaining effort
  - blocked tasks and why blocked
  - offer pile ids
  - quota math
14. Return format
When done, report:
- Files changed.
- Archived/seed cleanup completed.
- Scheduler changes made.
- Ledger changes made.
- Task-data edits made.
- Before/after Jul 13 hand.
- Quota math for fumes/steady/full.
- Any tasks intentionally left unchanged and why.

This prompt is broad enough for Claude to finish the half-done cleanup, but narrow enough that it should not wander into UI redesign.
