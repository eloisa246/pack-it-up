# Body Board and mobile layout refinement — session summary
**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Harness / model:** [Codex / GPT-5]
**Branch:** `codex-ui-pass2` (merged to main: yes)

### Done
- Reduced only the Psychiatry and Dentist marker sizes and tightened Dentist placement toward the approved Body Board mockup.
- Shifted the detail paper down as a unit, preserving its content area while covering the figure's feet.
- Converted the Overview tile grid to consume remaining viewport height, keeping all six tiles and the footer visible without scrolling at 390×844 and 509×939.
- Moved pressure copy down and tile section content right.
- Refined apartment clock, coin, room-progress, and box-count placement inside the existing chrome.
- Added `/?ui=1`, a live 390×844 layout editor for Body Board zones/paper, apartment HUD text boxes, and Overview text/grid placement. It persists editor drafts locally, supports Reset defaults, and copies JSON without changing normal production rendering.
- Added a paper-content X control and shortened apartment arrow labels to Bath, Dining, and Living without changing full room titles.
- Luna follow-up: expanded Paper content top to 45%, removed the selected-paper plus icon, and placed an explicit `N DAYS LEFT` countdown beneath the apartment date/time.
- Luna applied Eloisa's final exported editor JSON as the code defaults; the last repeated copy with apartment `dateY: 0` is authoritative.
- Verified empty and selected Body Board states, Overview viewport fit, and apartment HUD at phone sizes. Full typecheck and production build pass.

### Still broken / unfinished (do next)
- Remaining full reskins: Stretchy, Ledger, Inventory/Storage, Desk/Admin, and Settings.

### Do not
- Do not resize the other four Body Board zone markers.
- Do not reintroduce fixed-height Overview tiles; the remaining-height grid is what prevents mobile clipping.

### Quick verify
Open `/?ui=1`, change Psychiatry size, confirm the iframe updates immediately, then Reset defaults. At 390×844, open Overview and confirm the footer is visible without scrolling; then open Body Board and select OB/GYN.

### Suggested next-session order
1. Review the auto-deployed phone build.
2. Continue remaining screen reskins.
